age (int): Store the age of a person.
height (double): Store the height of a person in meters.
isEmployed (bool): Indicate whether the person is employed (true or false).
b) Print the values of all variables to the console using cout.

c) Modify the age variable by adding 5 to the current age.

//* To cocatentate you can do firstName + lastName
d) Concatenate the firstName and lastName variables to create a full name string and print it.

Exercise: Calculate the Median

Objective:

Write a C++ program that calculates and displays the median of a given set of numbers.

Instructions:

Input:

Ask the user to enter the number of elements in the set (e.g., 5).
Create an array to store the input numbers.
Allow the user to input the numbers one by one.
Sort the Array:

Implement a sorting algorithm (e.g., Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, or Insertion Sort) to arrange the numbers in ascending order.
Calculate the Median:

Determine the median of the sorted array.
If the number of elements is odd, the median is the middle element of the array.
If the number of elements is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.
Output:

Display the calculated median to the console.
Example:

Input:

Enter the number of elements: 5
Enter element 1: 7
Enter element 2: 3
Enter element 3: 9
Enter element 4: 1
Enter element 5: 5
Output:

The median of the set is: 5
