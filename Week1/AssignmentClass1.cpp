   * Assignment: Exploring cout with Formatting and Escape Sequences
   *
   * This assignment will explore the capabilities of the 'cout' object by:
   *   - Displaying text with different formatting options.
   *   - Using escape sequences to control output appearance.
   *   - Creating a simple ASCII art design.
   *
   * Instructions:
   * 1. Use 'cout' to print the following:
   *    - Your name on one line.
   *    - Your favorite color on the next line.
   *    - A simple message (e.g., "I love to code!") on the third line.
   * 2. Use the '\n' escape sequence to achieve the same output as in step 1.
   * 3. Use the '\t' escape sequence to create a tabbed output, 
   *    for example:
   *       Name: <Your Name>
   *       Color: <Your Favorite Color>
   * 4. Experiment with other escape sequences like '\"' (double quote) and '\\' (backslash) 
   *    to display these characters within your output.
   * 5. Create a simple ASCII art design using 'cout' and the escape sequences 
   *    you have learned. For example:
   *       /\
   *      /  \
   *     /____\ 
   *
   * This assignment will help you understand how to control the appearance 
   * of your output using 'cout' and its formatting options.
