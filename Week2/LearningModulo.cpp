     * Modulo Operator Explanation
     *
     * The modulo operator (%) in C++ is used to find the remainder after integer division. 
     * 
     * **Syntax:**
     * 
     * ```c++
     * int remainder = dividend % divisor; 
     * ```
     * 
     * **Where:**
     * 
     * - `dividend`: The number being divided.
     * - `divisor`: The number that divides the dividend.
     * - `remainder`: The integer that remains after the division.
     *
     * **Example:**
     * 
     * 10 / 3 = 3 with a remainder of 1
     * 
     * Therefore, 10 % 3 = 1
     *
     * **Common Uses:**
     *
     * - **Checking for even or odd numbers:** If a number is even, the remainder when divided by 2 is 0.
     * - **Looping and iteration:** The modulo operator is often used in loop conditions to control the number of iterations.
     * - **Array indexing:** To wrap around the end of an array.
     * - **Number theory:** For various number theory calculations, such as finding prime numbers.
