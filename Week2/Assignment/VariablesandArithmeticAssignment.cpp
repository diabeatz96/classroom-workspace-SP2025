   * Assignment: Variable Exploration
   *
   * This assignment focuses on understanding and using different data types in C++.
   *
   * 1. Declare and initialize the following variables:
   *    - **int age:** Your age (an integer value).
   *    - **double height:** Your height in meters (a decimal value).
   *    - **char initial:** The first letter of your first name (a single character).
   *    - **bool isStudent:** True if you are currently a student, False otherwise.
   *    - **string name:** Your full name.
   *
   * 2. Display the values of all the variables using 'cout'. 
   *    - Example: "My age is: " << age 
   *
   * 3. **Challenge:**
   *    - Create a new integer variable named 'yearOfBirth'.
   *    - Calculate your year of birth based on your current age and store the result in 'yearOfBirth'.
   *    - Display the calculated year of birth.
   *
   * This assignment will help you understand how to use different data types 
   * to represent various kinds of information in your C++ programs.
