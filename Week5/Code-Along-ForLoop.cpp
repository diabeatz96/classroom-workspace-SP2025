/*
Lets create a d
Prompt the user to enter a number (n).
Initialize a variable sum to 0. 
Use a for loop that starts at 2, increments by 2 in each step (so you only get even numbers), and continues as long as the current number is less than or equal to n.
Inside the loop, add the current even number to the sum.
After the loop finishes, print the final sum.
